When a worker arrive to our factory, our login system records his ID card number, 
the time of arrival, his name, and the time of leaving (if he goes home).
The log file is not complete, because it is queried in the middle of the day,
so some workers maybe still in the factory. In this case the time of leaving is undefined.
If somebody goes in and out multiple times a day, then only his last login record can
omit the time of leaving.
The file is sorted first by IDs, then by arrival time.

Questions:
----------

1. How many people are still in the factory?

2. Who tried to trick the login gate? 
(People, who seemingly did not leave the factory, but entered again at the gate.)

3. Did a system error occur? 
(System registered an arrival time of a person, which is earlier than a
former leaving time of the same person.)

4. How many invalid lines does the file contain? 

Use exception handling. Handle the exceptions, when the file cannot be opened,
or its format is invalid.

Add the following feature to the solution.
Create an attribute class, which holds the text messages used by the program.

Make the program international.
Create two files, one for each language, where each line will contain the corresponding
text message of the program (we can even use text formatters).
